        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains things like the author, copyright, navigation etc</li>
          <li>Other head (seen) elements: text elements, image elements, list elements.</li>
          <li>Other body (unseen) elements: meta-related elements, content division elements, semantic elements.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A . preceding class designates it a class selector therefore any HTML element assigned to the class card will gain its property assignments from CSS.</li>
          <li>Most of the basics are quite straight forward e.g. value is something like a specific colour or font and a property is something we're selecting to apply a value to. </li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are preferred as it allows developers to keep all their css rules to a single file which is easier to manage</li>
